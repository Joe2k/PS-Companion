## ðŸŽ“ **How to Use?**

1. Install the extension from [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ps-companion/jaleeakcpipiimnpmbjlimcgmojdjdad) (**_Has new features and UI_**)
2. Download the latest Station Details CSV from the new web app [psitseasy.ml](https://psitseasy.ml/) in the Project Bank Page.
3. Sort the rows of the sheet in the preference order you want. Do not change/delete any columns. Only rearrange with the rows.
4. Now you are ready to upload it in the [Fill station preferences page](http://psd.bits-pilani.ac.in/Student/StudentStationPreference.aspx)
5. Once in the Fill Station Preferences page click on the installed extension and a new section will appear on the top which you can use to upload the CSV file and click on Apply Changes! button.

## :new: New Features

-   There was many feedback on many stations were not there in project bank CSV file, which was there in the preference list page, and therefore all of like ~60 missing stations was on top with red color on them and it was tough to drag and drop them to wherever you wanted(especially to the end if the station was now your domain). Therefore we made some new features to help you out rearranging them by asking the domain preferences and putting only the needed domain stations on top and others on the bottom making it easy for you to rearrange.
